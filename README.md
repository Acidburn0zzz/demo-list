Web Audio Demo List
=========

A list of Web Audio API demos and applications. These applications use
the un-prefixed version of the API as described in the spec, and as
such should work on standards-compliant implementations of Web Audio.

In the future, this will become an attractive page, but for now, it's
just this README.

Each beat is then analyzed and matched to other similar sounding beats in the song. ”
